                    (the Suit) began working on the
                    LiveJournal.com project in 2001. Since then, she's done everything from
                    customer service to product planning to documentation to user advocacy
                    to QA testing to falling over exhausted because she's trying to do too
                    much at once. She left LiveJournal in 2007 to pursue a career in
                    writing. She hopes that with Dreamwidth Studios, she'll be able to use
                    her experience to create a place where creative people of all types will
                    find a home for their expression where they feel safe, welcomed, and
                    supported.

                    Denise lives in Baltimore, Maryland, with her long-suffering
                    wife, who fortunately enjoys the frequent "c'mere, look, isn't
                    this <em>cool</em>?" invocations, and three cats, who don't care about
                    the internet as long as they get fed on time.

                    (the Geek) began volunteering with LiveJournal.com in 2001 in technical
                    support and code development. He joined the staff in 2004, where he
                    contributed heavily to all areas of the site and worked on utilities
                    such as Perlbal and MogileFS that are now used by many other web sites.
                    After transitioning to Six Apart, Mark worked to design and build out
                    the systems infrastructure for the Vox.com product launch.
                - |
                    Since those days, Mark has been a MySQL DBA, managed an operations team,
                    and maintained a cadre of open source projects of his own while working
                    for companies such as Google, Mozilla, and Bump.

                    their two small sons. In his free time, he enjoys motorcycles, tabletop
                    and LARP gaming, and amateur radio (license KC8BCW).

                    (which is rarely), she hits the gym and kicks stuff around. In her spare
                    time, she hangs out in IRC with The Awesomest Ex-Boyfriend, knits, does calligraphy,
                    and tries not to get pulled in too many directions at once.

                    came into the LiveJournal volunteer IRC channel during one of the early
                    data center "power events" to find out what was going on. Denise obtained
                    another minion shortly thereafter. Azz specializes in thoughtful analysis
                    of any social media system she immerses herself in, and enjoys finding the
                    root needs underlying any request for more bells and whistles, and thinking
                    up a way to fulfil that need that fits in with the site's gestalt and actually
                    could be implemented. She was in IRC not looking busy enough when Denise and
                    Mark needed a team leader for spam, and now enjoys squashing spammers.

                    most of her commute using a suspiciously similar headset. Her hobbies include

                    with the characters in her current draft novel.

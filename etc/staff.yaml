                    (the Suit) began working on the 
                    LiveJournal.com project in 2001. Since then, she's done everything from 
                    customer service to product planning to documentation to user advocacy 
                    to QA testing to falling over exhausted because she's trying to do too 
                    much at once. She left LiveJournal in 2007 to pursue a career in 
                    writing. She hopes that with Dreamwidth Studios, she'll be able to use 
                    her experience to create a place where creative people of all types will 
                    find a home for their expression where they feel safe, welcomed, and 
                    supported.

                    wife, who fortunately enjoys the frequent "c'mere, look, isn't 
                    this <em>cool</em>?" invocations, and two cats, who don't care about the 
                    internet as long as they get fed on time.

                    (the Geek) began volunteering with LiveJournal.com 
                    in 2001 in technical support and code development. He joined the staff 
                    in 2004, concentrating both on feature development and backend 
                    development, where he contributed heavily to utilities, such as Perlbal 
                    and MogileFS, that are in wide use by many other sites. After 
                    transitioning to Six Apart, Mark worked to design and build out the 
                    systems infrastructure for the Vox.com product launch. In 2007, he moved 
                    to Iceland to program for CCP Games' EVE Online, before moving back to 
                    the US in early 2008 as a Senior Systems Administrator for the Mozilla 
                    Corporation.

                    Mark currently resides near San Francisco, CA with his wife Janine and
                    their canine companions. From time to time, he can be heard on the air as
                    KC8BCW, typically on the local 2M repeaters. 73s!

                    (for fun), which ended in her volunteering as part of the Support team
                    from 2007 to 2008. There, she picked up a love of digging through code and
                    diagnosing the freaky stuff. She bounces from one interesting thing to
                    another, and was hired as Dreamwidth's first employee because she can
                    do a little bit of everything -- and do it well!

                    came into the LiveJournal volunteer IRC channel during one
                    of the early data center "power events" to find out what was going on.
                    Denise obtained another minion shortly thereafter. Azz specializes in
                    thoughtful analysis of any social media system she immerses herself in,
                    and enjoys finding the root needs underlying any request for more bells
                    and whistles, and thinking up a way to fulfil that need that fits in
                    with the site's <cite>gestalt</cite> and actually could be implemented.
                    She was in IRC not looking busy enough when Denise and Mark needed a
                    team leader for spam, and now enjoys squashing spammers.

                    Azz lives in the foggy part of the San Francisco Bay Area. She
                    dreamed of becoming a Communications Officer like Lt. Uhura when she was
                    a child; now she spends much of her free time on IRC, on the phone with
                    Kat, and having bizarre, one-sided conversations with the characters in
                    her current draft novel.
